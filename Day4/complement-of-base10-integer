// Leetcode 1009
// The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.
// For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
// Given an integer n, return its complement.

int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    int x = 1;
    while (x <= n) {
        n ^= x;
        x <<= 1;
    }
    return n;
}
